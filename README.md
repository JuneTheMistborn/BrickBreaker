# Just a brick breaker
## Installation:
For now the game is just a python program. To play, download the .py and the .png files into the same directory
you must have python 3 on your computer and must install the pygame library (`pip install pygame`)

## Bugs n' stuff
Currently, the collision detection is fairly buggy. I plan on fixing that, adding a variable speed option, and maybe
allowing for the framerate to be changed. Once all of that is working, I will work on polishing up the looks of the game.
Once I've finished all of that, I will package it up into a simple executable and don't plan on adding anything else.
